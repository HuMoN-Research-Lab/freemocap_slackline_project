# Exploratory Analysis
Looking at findings, claims, or assumptions from other published data on slacklining to check if they apply to the data we're collecting.

- Right vs left hand motions in the mediolateral direction. Investigating the claim from [[Performance indicators for stability of slackline balancing]] that hand coordination is an indicator of slackline expertise.

- Right vs left hand motions in the vertical direction. Investigating the claim from [[Performance indicators for stability of slackline balancing]] that hand coordination is an indicator of slackline expertise.

- Foot motion patterns on the mediolateral plane, investigating the modeling from [[Balancing on tightropes and slacklines - Paoletti Mahadevan 2012]] and [[An LMI Approach to Controller Design for Balancing over Slackline - Iqbal 2019]] that model the "slackliners" foot as traveling along a circular track rather than on a springed horizontal track.
