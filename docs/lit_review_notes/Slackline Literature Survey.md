This document aims to do an abstract level survey of the existing published research related to slacklining. It does not aim to be exhaustive of all papers, rather its purpose is to find representative papers for the different categories of paper, with a special emphasis on papers related to explaining *how* people balance on slacklines (as opposed to purported benefits of doing so).

## Slacklining Balance Strategies

Vallery, Heike, and Julia Neumann. “Balancing on Slacklines: Modeling and Empirical Evaluation,” 2013.
- Use a relatively sophisticated model of the slackliner, assuming minimal energy expenditure and maximal margin of stability, and compared model predictions to experimental data. Calculated measures for energy consumption, stability, and leg decoupling. Found skilled slackliners use less energy and decouple their stance leg from their upper body compared to less skilled slackliners, but found no evidence for arms as dominant producer of angular momentum.

- "Slacklining is a simple, safe, and challenging training and rehabilitation tool for PD patients. It could be introduced into their physical activity routine to reduce the risk of falls and improve confidence related to fear of falling."

## Slacklining and Age

Schärli, Andrea, Melanie Keller, Silvio Lorenzetti, Kurt Murer, and Rolf van de Langenberg. “Balancing on a Slackline: 8-Year-Olds vs. Adults.” _Frontiers in Psychology_ 4 (2013). [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00208](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00208).
- Compared 8-year olds to young adults in a variety of measures while slacklining. The 8 year olds had lower postural stability, due in part to lower head and gaze stability. Measures were: "time on the slackline, stability on the slackline (calculated from slackline reaction force), gaze movement, head-in-space rotation and translation, trunk-in-space rotation, and head-on-trunk rotation."
