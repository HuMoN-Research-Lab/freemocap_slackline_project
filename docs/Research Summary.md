# Slackline Paper Outline Draft

## Introduction

A comprehensive literature review can be found at: [slackline lit review](https://humon-research-lab.github.io/freemocap_slackline_project/lit_review_notes/Slackline%20Literature%20Survey/). The relevant sections are 'Slackline Control Theory', 'Slacklining Balance Strategies', and 'Slacklining Performance Indicators and Measures of Stability'.

- Screenshot from left foot standing session showing 2d motion capture overlay, 3d motion capture animation, distance of center of mass from base of support in the mediolateral direction, and the state space (distance vs. velocity) of the mediolateral distance between the center of mass and base of support.

## Materials and Methods

### Slackline Protocol

We recorded motion capture of X skilled slackliners performing the same balance protocol while standing on a slackline. The balance protocol involved X seconds of single leg standing on the right foot, X seconds of single leg standeng on the right foot, and X seconds of tandem stance standing with the subject's preferred foot forward. The slackline used was X meters long, had Y kN of tension on it, and the webbing was a flat weave made of polyester. 

### Motion Capture

We recorded the motion capture using Freemocap's markerless motion capture software, with 2D pose estimation performed by Google's Mediapipe Holistic model. We used four GoPro Hero 7 Black cameras to record the video in 2.7K at a framerate of 60Hz. The recordings were made outside with the subjects wearing normal street clothes.
