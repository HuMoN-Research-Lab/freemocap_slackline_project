# Slackline Research Project

This documentation is a knowledge-base for the ongoing HuMon Research Lab study on slacklining. The study is using markerless motion capture data of slacklining to study neural control during a difficult balance task. It differs from prior research in studying the types of slacklines commonly used in the sport, rather than very short labratory models. 

This documentation includes a draft of a research paper, a literature review section, and a section storing project notes. Use the menu on the left to access the different sections. 

## Lit Review Notes

This section contains the literature review for the project, sorted by author and date. This covers slackline specific research papers relevant to our study, as well as literature related to walking and balance in both the biomechanics and neuroscience domains. A general survey is given in **Slackline Literature Survey**, which features citations with short descriptions that cover the wide range of published slackline specific research. 

## Project Notes

This section contains various notes made for the project. They are not very organized, and are probably not of interest to people outside the project.
